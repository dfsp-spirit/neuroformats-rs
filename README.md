The `neuroformats` crate provides access to structural neuroimaging data in Rust by implementing parsers for various file formats. The focus is on surface-based brain morphometry data, as produced from 3D or 4D magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) data by neuroimaging software suites like [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/), [CAT12](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/) and others.


## Background

In surface-based neuroimaging, basically meshes representing the 3D structure of the human cortex are reconstructed from a segmented 3D brain image. Then properties of the human brain, like the thickness of the cortex at a specific position, are computed from the reconstruction and stored as per-vertex data for the mesh.

Different zoom levels are displayed, and the triangles and vertex positions can be identified in the bottom row of images.")

## Installation

The `neuroformats` crate [is on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/neuroformats).

To use the library in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file, e.g.:

```toml
[dependencies]
neuroformats = "0.2.3"
```

## Features

* Read and write FreeSurfer per-vertex data in curv format (like `subject/surf/lh.thickness`): functions `neuroformats::read_curv` and `write_curv`
* Read and write brain meshes in FreeSurfer binary mesh format (like `subject/surf/lh.white`): `read_surf` and `write_surf`
* Read and write FreeSurfer label files (like `subject/label/lh.cortex.label`): `read_label` and `write_label`
* Read FreeSurfer brain surface parcellations (a.k.a. brain atlas, like `subject/label/lh.aparc.annot`): `read_annot`
* Read and write FreeSurfer brain volumes and other data from MGH and MGZ files: `read_mgh` and `write_mgh`

Various utility functions are implemented for performing common computations on the returned structs, e.g. computing the vox2ras matrix from the MGH header data or finding all vertices in a brain surface parcellation that belong to a certain brain atlas region. The library can also export brain meshes in standard mesh formats (Wavefront Object Format, PLY format, glTF), optionally with vertex colors based on per-vertex data (from curv or MGH/MGZ files) and the viridis colormap for quick visualization in tools like MeshLab or Blender.

## Documentation

### API docs

The `neuroformats` API docs can be found at [docs.rs/neuroformats](https://docs.rs/neuroformats).

### Short usage example

Read vertex-wise cortical thickness computed by FreeSurfer:

```rust
use neuroformats::read_curv;
let curv = read_curv("subjects_dir/subject1/surf/lh.thickness").unwrap();
let thickness_at_vertex_0 : f32 = curv.data[0];
```

You now have a `Vec<f32>` with the cortical thickness values in `curv.data`. The order of the values matches the vertex order of the respective brain surface reconstruction (e.g., the white surface mesh of the left brain hemisphere in `subjects_dir/subject1/surf/lh.white`).

### Full demo applications

* [brain_morph](./examples/brain_morph/src/main.rs): A simple application that demonstrates working with morphometry data. It shows how to load brain surfaces and the cortical thickness values for each vertex. It then proceeds to load a cortex mask, and uses it to compute the average cortical thickness per hemisphere, restricted to cortical vertices (i.e., ignoring the medial wall).
* [brain_atlas](./examples/brain_atlas/src/main.rs): Demonstrates how to load a brain surface atlas (the Desikan-Killiany atlas), find the vertices that belong to a specific atlas region, and the respective morphometry values for these vertices. The app then computes the average cortical thickness in a brain region.
* [brain_export](./examples/brain_export/src/main.rs) This app loads a brain mesh and per-vertex data (sulcal depth at each vertex), and maps the per-vertex values to colors using the viridis colormap. It does this for both hemispheres, then combines the meshes into a single mesh, centers it at the origin, merges the color values as well, and exports the result as a vertex-colored PLY file. The resulting file can be visualized in standard mesh viewers like Blender or MeshLab.

To run the demo apps, type ```cargo run```in the respective directory, e.g., in [./examples/brain_morph/](./examples/brain_morph/).

See the [neuroformats API docs](https://docs.rs/neuroformats) and the [unit tests in the source code](./src/) for more examples for using the neuroformats functions.

#### Related demo apps

These apps do not directly illustrate using the neuroformats API, but use Rust-based tools to visualize the exported brain meshes.

* There is a small command line demo application that loads a brain surface mesh and raytraces an image based on the mesh to a PNG file available in the [./examples/brain_rpt directory](./examples/brain_rpt/src/main.rs). The demo uses the [rpt crate by Eric Zhang and Alexander Morozov](https://lib.rs/crates/rpt) to do the raytracing. This can take quite a while on slower computers (more than 10 minutes on my laptop).
* A simple demo that loads a brain mesh into a simple scene using the bevy game engine for real-time viewing can be found in the [./examples/brain_bevy directory](./examples/brain_bevy/src/main.rs). This one requires some non-Rust system dependencies to run and is thus a bit harder to install. See the instructions in the main file if you're using some Debian-based Linux like Ubuntu.
