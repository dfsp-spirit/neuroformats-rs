# neuroformats
Handling of structural neuroimaging file formats for [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org/).

The `neuroformats` crate provides access to structural neuroimaging data in Rust by implementing parsers for various file formats. The focus is on surface-based brain morphometry data, as produced from 3D MRI images by tools like [FreeSurfer](http://freesurfer.net/), [CAT12](http://www.neuro.uni-jena.de/cat/) and others.

## Installation

The `neuroformats` crate [is on crates.io](https://crates.io/crates/neuroformats).

To use the library in your project, add it as a dependency in your `Cargo.toml` file, e.g.:

```toml
[dependencies]
neuroformats = "0.2.3"
```

## Features

* Read and write FreeSurfer per-vertex data in curv format (like `subject/surf/lh.thickness`): functions `neuroformats::read_curv` and `write_curv`
* Read and write brain meshes in FreeSurfer binary mesh format (like `subject/surf/lh.white`): `read_surf` and `write_surf`
* Read and write FreeSurfer label files (like `subject/label/lh.cortex.label`): `read_label` and `write_label`
* Read FreeSurfer brain surface parcellations (like `subject/label/lh.aparc.annot`): `read_annot`
* Read and write FreeSurfer brain volumes and other data from MGH and MGZ files: `read_mgh` and `write_mgh`

Various utility functions are implemented for performing common computations on the returned structs, e.g. computing the vox2ras matrix from the MGH header data or finding all vertices in a brain surface parcellation that belong to a certain brain atlas region.

## Documentation

### API docs

The `neuroformats` API docs can be found at [docs.rs/neuroformats](https://docs.rs/neuroformats).

### Usage example

Read vertex-wise cortical thickness computed by FreeSurfer:

```rust
use neuroformats::read_curv;
let curv = read_curv("subjects_dir/subject1/surf/lh.thickness").unwrap();
let thickness_at_vertex_0 : f32 = curv.data[0];
```

You now have a `Vec<f32>` with the cortical thickness values in `curv.data`. The order of the values matches the vertex order of the respective brain surface reconstruction (e.g., the white surface mesh of the left brain hemisphere in `subjects_dir/subject1/surf/lh.white`).

See the [neuroformats API docs](https://docs.rs/neuroformats) and the [unit tests in the source code](./src/) for more examples.
