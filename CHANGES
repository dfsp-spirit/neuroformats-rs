neuroformats Changes
=====================


If not explicitely mentioned, there are no breaking changes.

Current WIP
-----------
- Signficantly improve documentation by adding 3 more examples applications

Version 0.3.0
-------------
- Add support for merging meshes.


Version 0.2.6
-------------
- Add support for exporting meshes in glTF format, with and without vertex colors.


Version 0.2.5
-------------
- Add support for mapping per-vertex values to vertex colors, thanks to the colorgrad crate, see new neuroformats::values_to_colors() function
- Add convenience function FsSurface.colors_from_curv_file() that reads a curv file and used neuroformats::values_to_colors() to map to colors using the viridis colormap
- Add support for exporting meshes to PLY mesh format (ASCII version) via new BrainMesh.to_ply() function. Support export with and without vertex colors.
- Update all depencies to latest versions. Adapt code to braking change in external crate: ArrayBase.genrows() was deprecated and renamed to ArrayBase.rows()



Version 0.2.4
-------------
- Change: improve file reading performance by using buffered readers, thanks to @rbran
- Fix #4, In vec32minmax use iterators to avoid clone/sort a vector, thanks to @rbran
- Fix #3, Access to uninitialized memory, thanks to @rbran


Version 0.2.3
-------------
- Add write support for MGH and MGZ files: `write_mgh`.
- Add write support for FreeSurfer surface files: `write_surf`.
- Fix bug in reading of surface files (which would only happen for surfaces with an extreme vertex count that is never reached with brain meshes).
- Add write support for FreeSurfer label files: `write_label`.
- Add some utility methods for `FsLabel` structs.


Version 0.2.2
-------------
- Implement Display trait for structs FsAnnot, FsAnnotColortable, FsMgh, FsSurface and BrainMesh.
- Add basic mesh utility functions `coord_extrema` and `coord_center`.


Version 0.2.1
-------------
- Support writing per-vertex data to files in FreeSurfer 'curv' format: `neuroformats::write_curv`.
- Add methods to compute mesh center and extends for struct `neuroformats::BrainMesh`.
- Update dependency versions: ndarray 0.14 (up from 0.12.1) and adapt code: replace calls to now deprecated methods.
- New dependency: ndarray-stats 0.4.0.
- Implement Display trait for structs FsLabel and FsCurv.


Version 0.2.0
-------------
- Support reading FreeSurfer brain volumes and other data from MGH and MGZ files: `neuroformats::read_mgh`
- Support computation of vox2ras matrix for FsMgh structs: `neuroformats::FsMgh::vox2ras`
- BUGFIX: Make the fields of the `FsAnnot` struct public
- BREAKING: The fields `vertices` and `faces` of the `BrainMesh` struct have a new type. The type was `ndarray::Array2<f32>` before, and is now `Vec<f32>`. To restore the old behaviour, convert the vector using `ndarray::Array2::from_shape_vec`.
- Better documentation: more examples, cross links, and improved doc strings.


Version 0.1.0
--------------
- Initial release.
- Support reading FreeSurfer per-vertex data from curv files: `neuroformats::read_curv`
- Support reading of FreeSurfer brain meshes: `neuroformats::read_surf`
- Support reading of FreeSurfer label files: `neuroformats::read_label`
- Support reading of FreeSurfer brain surface parcellations from annot files: `neuroformats::read_annot`
